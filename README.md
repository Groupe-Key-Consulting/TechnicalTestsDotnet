Welcome to KC's technical tests

Description
-

You can find in this repository a series of little exercises, ordered by increasing difficulty levels.

The goal is for you to checkout the repository locally and write code to complete as many exercises as you can.

Then, you are to create a pull request here to allow us to review your code.

Structure of the project
- 

You will find in the solution two projects:

- TechnicalTests: contains the levels inputs, if any, and the decsription of the level's task.
	
- TechnicalTests.UnitTests: contains the unit tests for all the levels. You can proggress in the tests by removing the "Assert.Inconclusive" from the unit .
	You can add your own tests if you want, but the existing tests must remain as they are.
